# 🛵 DELIVORA AI — Smart ETA & Delay Prediction Engine

> Predict food delivery ETAs with machine learning. Reduce cancellations. Build customer trust.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Food delivery platforms suffer from inaccurate ETAs — causing customer frustration, order cancellations, and revenue loss. Existing systems rely on static formulas that ignore real-world variables like traffic congestion, weather conditions, rider experience, and peak-hour demand patterns.

**The result:** 63% of users cite ETA accuracy as their #1 frustration, and ~22% of delayed orders result in cancellations costing platforms $4–8 per order.

## 💡 Solution Overview

DELIVORA AI is an end-to-end ML pipeline that:

- Simulates 15,000 realistic food delivery orders across 4 Indian cities
- Engineers meaningful features from raw order data
- Trains a **RandomForestRegressor** to predict accurate delivery times
- Scores each order with a **delay risk probability** (Low / Medium / High)
- Surfaces predictions through a real-time **Streamlit dashboard**

## ✨ Features

- **Realistic synthetic data** — 13 correlated features with business-logic constraints (peak hours, weather, traffic)
- **Feature engineering pipeline** — derives `delivery_time`, `eta_error`, `is_delayed`, `is_peak_hour`
- **ML regression model** — RandomForest with 200 trees, tuned for production accuracy
- **Comprehensive evaluation** — MAE, RMSE, P50 and P90 absolute error metrics
- **Feature importance analysis** — identifies which inputs drive prediction error
- **Interactive dashboard** — live ETA prediction + risk badge via Streamlit
- **Modular codebase** — clean separation of data, features, and model layers

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/delivora-ai.git
cd delivora-ai
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run feature engineering

```bash
python src/features/feature_engineering.py
```

This reads `data/raw_orders_v3_realistic.csv` and outputs `data/engineered_orders.csv`.

### 4. Train the model

```bash
python src/models/model_training.py
```

This trains the RandomForest model, prints evaluation metrics, and saves `src/models/saved_model.pkl`.

### 5. Launch the dashboard

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
